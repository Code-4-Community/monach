Most important technologies:

- Typescript
- React
- React (Tanstack) Query for friendly hook based requests to our API and caching state
- Zod for data validation + types
- Zodios for type safe autogenerated API client
  - (Nearly) impossible to call the wrong endpoint
  - Inputs and outputs fulfill their Zod schema
- Fuse for client side fuzzy search
  - The total amount of data is small enough that we can get away with loading all the practitioners then doing search on the client side.
