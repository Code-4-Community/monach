# ü¶ã Monarch ü¶ã

## ‚ù§Ô∏è About the People

[Code4Community](https://c4cneu.com)'s newest project with [Lucy's Love Bus](https://lucyslovebus.org/).

Monarch is our internal code name for the prototype application we are developing to create a central hub for practitioners of integrative therapy. Our online search network will allow families across New England to discover which practitioners are in their area.

## ‚Ñπ About the Tech

This project a monorepo with three major subdirectories. Navigate to each of them (linked below) for a more specific README with technical details.

The software system is composed of five major components/libraries:

1. [**frontend**](./apps/frontend/README.md) : A web "frontend" client. The primary concern of this component is presentation code. This part of the system is built in React and Typescript, bundled as a single page application.
2. [**backend**](./apps/backend/README.md) : A web "backend" server. The primary concern of this component is exposing a HTTP interface to the data and core business logic of the search network.
3. [**common**](./libs/common/README.md) : Common units shared by and bundled with both of the above independent applications.
4. A database to securely store application data (AWS DynamoDB).
5. An authentication service to store user login information and issue auth tokens (AWS Cognito)

There's many more of course, but for a high level overview these 4.5 components are all you really need to be aware of.

## üî® Development

#### 1. Install Node v16.x

#### 2. Clone this repo

#### 3. Install dependencies, setup env

Go to the project root and run:
```
npm install
```

then, copy `.env.example` into `.env`

Fill in the blanks with the appropriate information. Ask the team directly for details.

:warning: **This is sensitive C4C information so don't leak it!**

#### 4. Serve the application

The simplest way to run both frontend and backend in a single terminal is:

```sh
nx run-many --parallel --target=serve --all

But you can run whatever `nx ...` command you want!

#### 5. Make changes, test, and commit!

Write tests, run tests!

```sh
nx run-many --target=test --all
```

Ideally commit using Conventional Commit style. Emojis optional but always encouraged.
