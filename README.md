# ü¶ã Monarch ü¶ã 

## ‚ù§Ô∏è About the People

[Code4Community](https://c4cneu.com)'s newest project with [Lucy's Love Bus](https://lucyslovebus.org/).

Monarch is our internal code name for the prototype application we are developing to create a central hub for practitioners of integrative therapy. Our online search network will allow families across New England to discover which practitioners are in their area.

## üõ† About the Tech

This project a monorepo with three major subdirectories. Navigate to each of them (linked below) for a more specific README.

The software system is composed of four major components:
1. [**frontend**](./frontend/README.md) : A web "frontend" client. The primary concern of this component is presentation code. This part of the system is built in React and Typescript, bundled as a single page application.
2. [**backend**](./backend/README.md) : A web "backend" server. The primary concern of this component is exposing a HTTP interface to the data and core business logic of the search network.
3. [**common**](./common/README.md) : Common units shared by and bundled with both of the above independent applications.
4. A database to securely store application data.
